# Kanji a Day
One of the more difficult parts of language learning, and memorization in general, is consistency. Oftentimes, slacking on memorization for a week can make you easily lose track of material incredibly quickly. Especially with languages like Japanese and Chinese, the sheer amount of characters needed to be memorized from the get-go can be daunting. With Kanji a Day, looking at just one Kanji (or more!) a day can help with "passive learning" and reinforce the pacing needed to retain information.

# Features

## Swiping
One of my goals is to make this app gesture based and have as little confusion with navigation as possible. In the main screen, there's a deck of cards with the kanji from the past 14 days. You can swipe a card to the side, and it goes to the back of the deck. This will also affect the home screen widget, as the widget always displays the topmost card of the deck.

## Reshuffle
If you feel the kanji of the current day isn't useful, whether you've learned it in the past etc., you can tap the the button on the left to reshuffle. You can add as many cards as you want to the deck, and it won't discard the prior 14 days until midnight.

## Detail View
When tapping on a card, it brings up a more detailed view, containing various words that contain the kanji as well as a plethora of example sentences, all paired with English translations. (data from Tatoeba)

## Kanji Grade Level Range

Whether you're just starting to learn kanji, or you're just trying to knock the last few kanji out before fluency, you're able to adjust the level of kanji drawn for your needs. There's also an option to clear the deck in case you feel like it (mostly to help me debug). |
